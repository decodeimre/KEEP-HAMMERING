### KEEP HAMMERING WORKOUT TRACKER ###

### Goal for the App ###
This is an App for planning and tracking Workouts. It is my first bigger project while on a learning path to become a MERN stack web developer. 

The goal is to be able to put your own workouts together by selecting a day, selecting exercises based on the target area (target muscle) and save that workout (planning part). While doing the workout or after, you can then edit the exercises and log your used weights and number of repetitions (tracking part).

Based on the user, the app should remember your workouts, offering the base data for future implementations like progress statistics for every target muscle. Copying a workout done in the past to do it again another day should also be an option.

The app will be constructed with the "mobile first" approach to make it usable on mobile phone (in the gym). We'll see how that works out though...

It will also be the first time for me using BOOTSTRAP for styling. Because, why not?


### Implementations ###
